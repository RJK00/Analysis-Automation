Pybank: This script reads the financial records of a company from a .csv file and outputs an analysis in the form of a text file to the "Analysis" folder. The resulting text file will contain various calculations and observations such as the total months observed, net PnL, average PnL change, greatest increase in profits (data & value), and the greatest recorded loss (date & value).

Pypoll: Pypoll was created to streamline the vote counting process of an election by analyzing voter and candidate data from the included dataset. Similar to Pybank, Pypoll will create an easy-to-read text file containing the total votes casted, list of candidates and their election results (percent votes recieved by each candicate and total number of respective votes), and the winner of the election based on the popular vote.
